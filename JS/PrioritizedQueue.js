 Problem statement
 =================
 Implement a Priority Queue. This should function like a normal queue, but allowing for retrieving the top priority item, rather than the first in.

 - Assume that features of the most recent language standard are available.
 - We expect good performance.
 - If missing more requirements details, just make reasonable assumptions of
 your own.


Example Usage:

    queue = new PriorityQueue();
    var dataObjectOne = {thing: "value"};
    var priorityOne = 1;
    var dataObjectTwo = {thing: "value2"};
    var priorityOne = 2;
    queue.push(dataObjectOne,priority);
    queue.push(dataObjectTwo,priority);
    
    var data = queue.pop();
    console.log(data);
    
Example output:
    {thing: "value2"}
