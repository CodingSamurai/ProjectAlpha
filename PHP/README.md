# PHP tests

Herein are various datastructure tests for PHP as well as some general fun puzzles written in PHP.

Feel free to pick and choose tests to complete but please complete the ones that are specifically assigned as well.

### General Guidelines:
- We expect good performance.
- If missing more requirements details, just make reasonable assumptions of
your own.
- We expect you to write legible code.
- Solution must be simple and compact. No defensive coding, no comments, no
unrequested features.
