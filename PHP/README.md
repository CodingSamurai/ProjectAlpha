# PHP tests

Herein are various datastructure tests for PHP as well as some general fun puzzles written in PHP.

### General Guidelines:
- We expect good performance.
- If missing more requirements details, just make reasonable assumptions of
your own.
- We expect you to write legible code.
- Solution must be simple and compact. No defensive coding, no comments, no
unrequested features.
