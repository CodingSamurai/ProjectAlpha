# Prompt:

 Implement ActualCollection and ActualSortedCollection
 such that they implement the interfaces in iCollection and so the example application in TestCollections outputs the expected results

 This implementation should be general purpose, scalable and readable.

 example output:
```php
key
stdClass Object
(
)
key8
stdClass Object
(
)

Sorting...

key8
stdClass Object
(
)
key2
stdClass Object
(
)
key
stdClass Object
(
)
```
